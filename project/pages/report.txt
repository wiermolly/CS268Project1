Molly and Sam. Thank you for creating a great website for my husband Kevin. He is going to love all of the features.

Things I love. The photo images on each web section really depict what Kevin would like to show off as he begins to offer different classes.

The one thing I would change is on the first page. Could you please make sure people know that his class offerings are free. He would just like to get more people outside enjoying nature so he believes free training is the best approach.

Kim
