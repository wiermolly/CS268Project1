                            The bald eagle is a bird of prey found in North America. A sea eagle, it 
                            has two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle.
                             Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico.
                              It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.

                                Loons (North America) or divers (United Kingdom / Ireland) are a group of aquatic 
                                birds found in many parts of North America and northern Eurasia. xLoons, which are 
                                the size of a large duck or a small goose, resemble these birds in shape when swimming.
                                 Like ducks and geese the loon's toes are connected by webbing.

                                Beavers are the second-largest living rodents after the capybaras. They have stout bodies 
                                with large heads, long chisel-like incisors, brown or gray fur, hand-like front feet, webbed back feet and flat, scaly tails.

                                The moose is a member of the New World deer subfamily and is the largest and heaviest extant species in 
                                the deer family. Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the 
                                Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates. Hunting and other human activities have caused a
                                 reduction in the size of the moose's range over time.

                            The American black bear is a medium-sized bear endemic to North America.
                             They typically live in largely forested areas, but will leave forests in search of food, and are sometimes 
                             attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food. Despite the name, some subspecies 
                             can be brown or even blond in coloration.
